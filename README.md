This is a set of useful MATLABÂ® functions (not really "hacks", but hey, the name is cool). I wrote them for myself and decided to share. I will keep on adding new functions in the future (or not).
I am not sure if the functions work in GNU Octave or not.
If you know how to improve something, make a pull request or give me a hint.
